LILO Reservation Search

•	What is the fastest way to search for a guest reservation with a guest in front of you….
•	Cache all Reservation information for all of WDW (for TODAY)
    o	You can start with existing services to search reservations to get started or use cache services from DME as a test for "today's" reservations (Johnny Chacon can give you details on how they load a cache for DME)
•	Entry by Cast member is a verbal discussion with the guest for last name or reservation number if available
•	Allow the Cast Member to just type and continue looking at the guest… let the computer do the work
    o	Text entry field (do not make the agent click around the screen), once you are done typing the search starts in the bottom half of the screen (determine a time limit)
    o	Phonetic and wild card search (allow the Resort name to be entered as well)
    o	If there agent needs to search again they just type in new or refined information
        	DME --- Remove the Import Reservation – this seems to be an extra step that is not required (you can assume this is the next step)
    o	Results from cache search should look like Google results with best results at top and guest information if possible for validation/magic (city, state, favorite character, Celebration)
    o	Use Reservation and MDX information if possible
